# gender-classification

I work on [this](https://youtu.be/T5pRlIbr6gg?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) Siraj Raval's YouTube video about gender classification challange using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "scikit-learn"). This code use Decision Tree, Random Forest, Nearest Centroid Neighbors to train a small dataset that manually defined.
I recommend to watch the full video of him and read the scikit-learn documentation for better understanding

Thank you
