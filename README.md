# gender-classification

I work on [this](https://youtu.be/T5pRlIbr6gg?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) Siraj Raval's YouTube video about gender classification challange using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "scikit-learn"). This code use [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html), [Nearest Centroid Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-classification) to train a small dataset that manually defined.

I recommend you to watch the full video of him and read the scikit-learn documentation for better understanding

Thank you,
